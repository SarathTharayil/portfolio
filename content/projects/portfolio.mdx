Just a heads up before the initial changelogs. The current theme is based entirely on the chronark theme by Andreas. Find the original website from the website link given above.

## Version 1.1
The website is modified fully from the chronark theme

## Version 1.2

The previous version had a different hero/home page designed by chronark. I have now modified it and made a custome home page with regular top navbars.
> **Fun Fact** : All the coding for the modifications are still done by chatgpt

The old page can be viewed using this [link](/oldhome).

## Version 1.3
Changes:

1. Posts page updated with better subheadings. Previously it had something cringe.
2. Featured posts are updated with content.
3. Posts page's heading moved slighly down so that it is viewed correclty in mobile devices
